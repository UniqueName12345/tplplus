Terrible Programming Language+ is Now Ghoti++
=============================================

Well, folks, Terrible Programming Language+ has kicked the bucket. The codebase was giving us more headaches than a Monday morning, so we had to pull the plug prematurely.

Yeah, not the best look when a language is D.O.A. It's like getting an antivirus that never bothers updating.

But hey, don't bother trying to run Terrible Programming Language now. It's basically limited to basic math operators—no fancy stuff.

If you're feeling nostalgic (or masochistic), you can check out the [old readme](oldreadme.md). Fair warning, it's more formal than a penguin at a black-tie event.

Now, Ghoti++ is the new kid on the block, and our documentation is going for a more casual vibe. The complete opposite of the """documentation""" Terrible Programming Language had. No plans to resurrect Terrible Programming Language+, it's a relic now.

We're all ears for communication, especially me, UniqueName12345, the brains behind both Terrible Programming Language+ and Ghoti++. If you want to chat about Ghoti++, head to [the discussions tab](https://github.com/UniqueName12345/GhotiPlusPlus/discussions). And remember, the Issues tab is old and bad — never go there.

For a general chit-chat, hit me up on Scratch. Username: DifferentDance8. Scratch won't send any link to this repository to oblivion, unlike some other methods I have.

By the way, it's "Ghoti++," not just "Ghoti" as the old readme hinted. Someone beat us to that name for a different esolang.
