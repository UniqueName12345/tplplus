Terrible Programming Language+
==============================

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
--------------------

* * *

**Transition to Ghoti:** In response to the inherent complexities of the Terrible Programming Language codebase, a strategic decision has been taken to eventually archive TPL+. Despite the anticipated challenges of this transition, a new esolang, "Ghoti++," is slated for development from the ground up. Upon the public release of Ghoti++, a dedicated repository and forum topic will be established to facilitate its adoption.

The sole commonality between Ghoti++ and TPL+ is their internal use of Lark; beyond this, they are distinct entities.

The removal of even the fundamental features of TPL in TPL+ underscores the commitment to this transition. Currently, TPL+ only supports basic mathematical operators, with no provision for output.

The remainder of this readme will be presented in past tense to accurately reflect this evolution.

Overview
--------

* * *

**Introduction:** Terrible Programming Language+ (TPL+) represents an evolution of the esoteric programming language Terrible Programming Language, initially conceived by jdev082. Notably, the nomenclature of "Terrible" was adjusted to be 99% accurate, deviating slightly from its initial 100% designation.

Rationale for Deviation
-----------------------

* * *

**Enhancements:** TPL+ signifies a departure from the limited functionality of TPL, which previously only encompassed basic printing and setting functions. The significance of this deviation lies in the introduction of additional features within TPL+. However, this expansion comes at the cost of non-backward compatibility with TPL, rendering the new commands incompatible with the original language. Consequently, TPL remains unable to seamlessly incorporate the advancements introduced by TPL+.
